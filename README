  BUG CONTROLLER: Uploader sending all data as application/octet-stream, should probably have middleware to properly and authoritatively correct this
    Scratch that, the model should re-interpret it really.
  TODO JS: Make upload_manager.js have it's own callbacks, instead of hard-coded ones inside filedrop
  
Workflow:
  New Asset:
    Textfield at top of tags list for quick entry
      autocomplete for last 'word'
      insert tag elements as soon as previous 'word' ends
        with related tags extending out to the side
          can be clicked without losing focus to enter that related tag as the next word in textfield
      OR
      autocomplete for last 'word'
        once word is chosen, insert tag element
        and show related tags for that word, clickable
        same related tags stay until you press space, then it shows related tags for the last entered tag (could be the one you just clicked on)
